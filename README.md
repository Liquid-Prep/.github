Liquid Prep offers an end-to-end solution for farmers who want to optimize water usage, conserve resources and maximize crop yield, especially in times of drought. It is designed for farmers worldwide who want or need access to advanced agricultural advice.

By using an intuitive mobile app, local soil sensors, and backend service in IBM Cloud, farmers can be better informed on how to use limited water supplies and increase their chances of growing healthy crops, even on small plots of land.
