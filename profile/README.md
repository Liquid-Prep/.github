Liquid Prep offers an end-to-end solution for farmers who want to optimize their water usage; especially during times of drought. It is specially designed for low-literate farmers in developing countries who also need access to advanced agricultural advice to be successful.

By using an intuitive mobile app, soil moisture sensor module, and backend service in IBM cloud, farmers can be better informed on when to use limited water supplies and increase their chances of growing healthy crops for their small plots of land.
